# Calling Watson Conversation - Adding a telephoine voice interface to your chatbot with Discovery 

This application demonstrates how you can add a telephone voice interface to a chatbot developed  with the [Watson Conversation Service](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/conversation/index.html#about). The telephone voice interface is handled by [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/about-nexmo) a third pary service available in the  IBM Cloud . Since the Watson Converation service only recognizes text input and only generates text output,  we also utilize  [Watson Speech to Text service](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/getting-started.html) and [Watson Text to Speech service](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/text-to-speech/getting-started.html) to go between the text data needed to interface with the Conversation service and and the voice data needed to interface with Nexmo and the person calling your chatbot.

Acknowledgements: This application extends the Nexmo sample [Real-time Call Transcription Using IBM Watson and Python](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/10/03/real-time-call-transcription-ibm-watson-python-dr/). Many thanks to Sam Manchin of Nexmo for providing this. 

## How the app works

Hereâ€™s an overview of how  it all works. 

<img src="readme_images/switch_config.png" width="550"></img>

As shown in the diagram, you link your Nexmo number to an instance of this application that receives the voice data from an  incoming phone call . The app calls Watson Speech to Text to convert the voice data to text and then sends that text as input to a chatbot powered by a Watson Conversation workspace.  The reply from  the chatbot is  then sent to Watson Text to Speech and the resulting voice data is sent back to the caller connected to your virtual number . 


## Deploy to IBM Cloud
[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://metrics-tracker.mybluemix.net/stats/527357940ca5e1027fbf945add3b15c4/button.svg)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/djccarew/calling-watson-conversation.git)

## Getting Started locally

<img src="readme_images/deploy-locally.png"></img>

### Before you begin

-  Ensure that you have a [Bluemix account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/). While you can deply the app locally, you must still use Bluemix for the Watson services.
-  Ensure that you have [a Nexmo account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up). Make sure to go through the verification process to complete the sign up. You will be called or sent a text with an activation code that you must enter to complete the signup. You will get a free account with a &euro;2 credit which is more than enough to get this app up and running. To keep going beyond that  you can add credit to your Nexmo account in &euro;10 euro increments (about $12 USD).
- To run the app locally you will need to install [ngrok] (https://ngrok.com/download) which will give the app running on your local machine a public url that can be used by Nexmo to interact with your app. If you run the app in Bluemix ngrok is not required.



### Create the services

1. In Bluemix, [create a Conversation Service instance](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?target=/catalog/services/conversation/).
  

2. In Bluemix, [create a Speech to Text Service instance](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?target=/catalog/services/speech-to-text/).
  
3. In Bluemix, [create a Text to Speech Service instance](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?target=/catalog/services/text-to-speech/).
  
### Get Conversation Workspace ID

In order for this app to interact with your Watson Conversation workspace you  need to configure it with the unique  Workspace ID.  The Conversation service will have a sample workspace already created (Car Demo) so you can use that if you don't have another workspace to work with. If you're new to Watson Conversation, note that a workspace is a container for all the artifacts that define the behavior of your service (ie: intents, entities and chat flows). 

For more information on workspaces, see the full  [Conversation service documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/conversation/configure-workspace.html#configuring-a-conversation-workspace).

1. Navigate to the Bluemix dashboard and select the **Conversation** service you created.

  ![](readme_images/workspace_dashboard.png)

2. Click the **Launch Tool** button under the **Manage** tab. This opens a new tab in your browser, where you are prompted to login if you have not done so before. Use your Bluemix credentials.

  ![](readme_images/workspace_launch.png)

3. Refresh your browser. A new workspace tile is created within the tooling. Select the _menu_ button within the workspace tile, then select **View details**:

### Building locally

To build the application:

1. Clone the repository  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/conversation-with-discovery
   ```

2. Navigate to the `conversation-with-discovery` folder

3. For Windows, type `gradlew.bat build`. Otherwise, type `./gradlew build`.

4. The built WAR file (conversation-with-discovery-0.1-SNAPSHOT.war) is in the `conversation-with-discovery/build/libs/` folder.

### Running locally

1. Copy the WAR file generated above into the Liberty install directory's dropins folder. For example, `<liberty install directory>/usr/servers/<server profile>/dropins`.  
2. Navigate to the `conversation-with-discovery/src/main/resources` folder. Copy the `server.env` file.  
3. Navigate to the `<liberty install directory>/usr/servers/<server name>/` folder (where < server name > is the name of the Liberty server you wish to use). Paste the `server.env` here.  
4. In the `server.env` file, in the **"conversation"** section.  
  - Populate the "password" field.
  - Populate the "username" field.
  - Add the **WORKSPACE_ID** that you [copied earlier](#workspaceID).  
5. In the `server.env` file, in the **"discovery"** section.  
  - Populate the "password" field.
  - Populate the "username" field.
  - Add the **COLLECTION_ID** and **ENVIRONMENT_ID** that you [copied from the Discovery UI](#environmentID) 
  - (Optional) Edit the **DISCOVERY_QUERY_FIELDS** field if you set up a custom configuration . [Learn more here](custom_config/config_instructions.md).
6. Start the server using Eclipse or CLI with the command `server run <server name>` (use the name you gave your server). If you are using a Unix command line, first navigate to the `<liberty install directory>/bin/` folder and then `./server run <server name>`.
7. Liberty notifies you when the server starts and includes the port information.  
8. Open your browser of choice and go to the URL displayed in Step 6. By default, this is `http://localhost:9080/`.
